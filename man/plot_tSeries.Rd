\title{Plot Time-Series Data for a Test Chemical and Corresponding Vehicle Control}
\usage{
plot_tSeries(
  pmr0,
  chemical,
  vector,
  prsp = "SA",
  no.A = 10,
  unit.t = "2 min",
  unit.mov = "cm",
  unit.conc = paste0("Î¼", "M")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmr0}{- is a pmr0 dataset formatted as below
\itemize{
  \item srcf - name of file holding raw data
  \item acid - assay component id (Here ZFpmrALD-20-40-40)
    Zebrafish photomotor resonse, Acclimation/Light/Dark-20 minutes-40 minutes-40 minutes
  \item cpid - chemical name
  \item apid - assay plate id DNT###
  \item rowi - row on plate
  \item coli - column on plate
  \item wllt - well type according to tcpl mc0 format
   t = test, v = vehicle control
  \item wllq - well quality indicates if observation is viable for analysis
    1 = yes, 0 = no
  \item conc - concentration of chemical
  \item vtj - measurements at time period j for j /in {1,2,...,n}
    Here n = 50
}}

\item{chemical}{- string corresponding to name of chemical of interest}

\item{prsp}{- specifies SS or SA perspective, can take value "SS" or "SA"}

\item{no.A}{- number of time periods in acclimation period}

\item{unit.t}{- length of time contained in each time period. Defaults to "2 Minutes"}

\item{unit.mov}{- unit of distance traveled by subjects. Defaults to cm / 2 min}

\item{unit.conc}{- unit of chemical concentration. Defaults to $\mu$M}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object displaying total movement time-series data from one of two perspectives
  SS
  \itemize {
    \item time series by individual
    \item time series of concentration-group means for each time period
    \item time series faceted by chemical concentration grouping
  }
  SA
  \itemize {
    \item time series of concentration-group means for each time period
    \item curves for each concentration are plotted together and are colored
    \item colored ribbons representing 50% confidence intervals about time period means
  }
}
\description{
Plots total movement per 2-minute bin time-series data of a test chemical and
it's corresponding vehicle control using either a Subject-Specific (SS)
perspective or a Sample Averaged (SA) perspective. User provides pmr0
formatted table, a character object specifying chemical to be plotted, and a
string object "SS" or "SA" specifying graphical method.

Subject Specific (SS) perspective fits curves to each individual's speed data
and plots. Population Averaged (SA) perspective fits to the mean speed at each
time period for a concentration group.
