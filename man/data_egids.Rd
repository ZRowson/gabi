\itemize{
  \item srcf - name of file that is being formatted
  \item acid - assay component id (Here ZFlmrA/L/D-20-40-40)
    Zebrafish locomotor response, Acclimation/Light/Dark- _l_ minutes- _m_ minutes- _n_ minutes
  \item cpid - chemical name
  \item apid - assay plate id DNT###
  \item rowi - row on plate
  \item coli - column on plate
  \item wllt - well type according to tcpl mc0 format
   t = test, v = vehicle control
  \item wllq - well quality indicates if observation is viable for analysis
    1 = yes, 0 = no

\description{
Takes a mc0 data.table and uses plate numbers to return
experimental groups. Experimental groups are returned
as a list with chemical names in each group and plate
