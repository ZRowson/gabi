}
\value{
A list with average speed in each light level for each fish
  \itemize{
    \item avgS_L - average speed in light
    \item avgS_D - average speed in dark

\description{
Calculates average speed per light level (dark or light) for
individual fish. User provides a pmr0 table and inputs
number of time periods for each experimental stage:
acclimation, light, and dark. A pmr0 table
