\title{Calculate average acceleration and jerk}
\usage{
calc_avgAJ(data, no.A = 10, no.L = 20, no.D = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is a pmr0 formatted data.table
\itemize{
  \item srcf - name of file that is being formatted
  \item acid - assay component id
  \item cpid - chemical name
  \item apid - assay plate id
  \item rowi - row on plate
  \item coli - column on plate
  \item wllt - well type according to tcpl mc0 format
  \item wllq - well quality indicates if observation is viable for analysis
  \item conc - concentration of chemical
  \item tj - measurements at time period j for j /in {1,2,3,...,n}
}}

\item{no.A}{number of measurements made in acclimation period}

\item{no.L}{number of measurements made in light period}

\item{no.D}{number of measurements made in dark period}
}
\value{
A list with average jerk in each light level for each fish
  \itemize{
    \item avgA_L - average acceleration in light
    \item avgA_D - average acceleration in dark
    \item avgJ_L - average jerk in light
    \item avgJ_D - average jerk in dark
  }
}
\description{
Calculates average acceleration and jerk per light level (dark or
light) for individual fish. User provides a pmr0 table and inputs
number of time periods for each experimental stage: acclimation,
light, and dark.
}
\details{
Excludes acceleration and jerk values during transitions
(freeze and startle) from calculation of averages.
