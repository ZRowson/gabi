\usage{
as_mc0(table, rval = NULL, no.A = 10, no.L = 20, no.D = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{is a lmr0 dataset formatted as below
\itemize{
  \item srcf - name of file that is being formatted
  \item acid - assay component id (ZFlmrALD-l-m-n)
    Zebrafish locomotor response, Acclimation/Light/Dark- _l_ minutes- _m_ minutes- _n_ minutes
  \item cpid - chemical name
  \item apid - assay plate id
  \item rowi - row on plate
  \item coli - column on plate
  \item wllt - well type according to tcpl mc0 format
   t = test, v = vehicle control, c/o = positive control
  \item wllq - well quality indicates if observation is viable for analysis
    1 = yes, 0 = no
  \item conc - concentration of chemical
  \item vtj - measurements at time period j for j /in {1,2,...,n}
    Here n = 50
}}

\item{rval}{is the name of desired endpoint as a string}

\item{no.A}{number of measurements made in acclimation period, defaults to 10}

\item{no.L}{number of measurements made in light period, defaults to 20}

\item{no.D}{number of measurements made in dark period, defaults to 20}
